# Contributing to Brotmon

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Brotmon as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Make sure your code lints
4. Issue a pull request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Follow the existing code style and conventions
3. Include comments in your code where necessary
4. Update any related documentation

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing formatting style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Commit Messages

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense
- Keep the first line around 100 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Example:

```commitmessage
Add dark mode toggle button
Fix user authentication bug (#123)
Update documentation for API endpoints
```

Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-username/brotmon/issues)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary

- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Please use the issue tracker and:
